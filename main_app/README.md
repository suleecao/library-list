### Overview
This app gives users the ability to track library book in a wishlist form. It also lets users mark the date finished, if applicable. Users can create, read, update, and delete books from their wishlist. Users are also able to rate a book from 0-5 stars in the edit page. The app has a arty and eclectic theme with images of drawings from op art pioneer Bridget Riley, Brazilian mid-century modern design, and contemporary luxury fashion. Django's built in authentication handles login/logout and sign up.
